Now, we are going to create a canvas where we will be having four UI components. They are two raw image components and two buttons.
We will be having two raw image components in order to display the local and the remote video respectively. We will be having two buttons with the text "Join" and "Leave" in order to start and  end the communication. In order to create canvas, right click on the sample scene area and choose UI, and from there, we'll choose canvas.
